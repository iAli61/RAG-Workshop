# GPT-4: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4

**GPT-4** is OpenAI's fourth-generation large language model, representing a significant advancement in artificial intelligence and natural language processing capabilities.

## Overview

GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that accepts both text and image inputs and produces text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.

## Key Capabilities

### Multimodal Understanding
Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 can process and understand images alongside text, enabling:
- Visual question answering
- Image captioning
- Document analysis with embedded figures and charts

### Enhanced Reasoning
GPT-4 demonstrates improved capabilities in:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Breaking down multifaceted problems into manageable steps
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Solving advanced mathematics and logic problems
- **Code Generation**: Writing, debugging, and explaining code across multiple programming languages
- **Creative Writing**: Generating coherent, contextually appropriate long-form content

## Architecture

While OpenAI has not disclosed the exact architecture details, GPT-4 is believed to:
- Use a transformer-based architecture
- Have significantly more parameters than GPT-3 (175 billion parameters)
- Employ mixture-of-experts techniques for efficient computation
- Be trained on a diverse dataset including text from the internet, books, and code

## Training Process

GPT-4 training involved:
1. **Pre-training**: Learning from a massive text corpus to predict the next token
2. **Instruction Tuning**: Fine-tuning on high-quality instruction-following examples
3. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: Optimizing responses based on human preferences

## Safety and Alignment

GPT-4 incorporates advanced safety measures:
- Reduced hallucination rates compared to earlier models
- Better adherence to ethical guidelines
- Improved resistance to adversarial inputs
- Content filtering to prevent harmful outputs

## Benchmark Performance

GPT-4 achieves remarkable scores:
- **Bar Exam**: 90th percentile
- **SAT Math**: 89th percentile
- **Codeforces Rating**: 93rd percentile
- **AP Biology**: 5/5 score

## API Access

GPT-4 is available through:
- **OpenAI API**: Direct API access for developers
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Enterprise-grade deployment with security features
- **ChatGPT Plus**: Consumer-facing chat interface

## Limitations

Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has known limitations:
- Knowledge cutoff date (training data ends at a specific point)
- Can still generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- May exhibit biases present in training data
- Computational cost and latency considerations
