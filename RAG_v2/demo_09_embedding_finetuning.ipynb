    "# Demo #9: Fine-Tuning Embedding Models for Domain-Specific RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Demonstrate how fine-tuning an embedding model on domain-specific query-passage pairs significantly improves retrieval accuracy compared to generic embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts Demonstrated\n",
    "1. **Embedding Model Fine-Tuning**: Adapting pre-trained embeddings to specialized domains\n",
    "2. **Contrastive Learning with Triplet Loss**: Training with (query, positive, negative) triplets\n",
    "3. **Domain Adaptation**: Improving performance on specialized terminology (Medical domain)\n",
    "4. **Comparative Evaluation**: Measuring retrieval accuracy, MRR, and answer quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Context\n",
    "This is Demo #9 in the Advanced RAG Workshop series, focusing on optimization and production readiness. Fine-tuning embeddings is often more practical than fine-tuning large generator LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Flow: Fine-Tuned vs Generic Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generic Embeddings (Baseline):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query ‚Üí Generic Embedding ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí Retrieved Chunks (may miss domain-specific nuances)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine-Tuned Embeddings (Enhanced):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Domain-Specific Triplets ‚Üí Fine-Tune Embedding Model ‚Üí \n",
    "Query ‚Üí Fine-Tuned Embedding ‚Üí Vector Search ‚Üí Retrieved Chunks (domain-optimized)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: Fine-tuning pulls domain-relevant query-document pairs closer in embedding space while pushing irrelevant pairs apart through contrastive learning."
