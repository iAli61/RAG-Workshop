```bash
echo $AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
```

**Issue:** Missing dependencies  
**Solution:** Install required packages:
```bash
pip install llama-index-core llama-index-llms-azure-openai llama-index-embeddings-azure-openai
pip install llama-index-retrievers-bm25 sentence-transformers networkx
```

**Issue:** Data files not found  
**Solution:** Ensure you're running notebooks from the `RAG_graph_v5` directory
