# **Mastering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): From Fundamentals to Advanced Architectures**

**Workshop Duration:** Two Days

**Target Audience:** This workshop is designed for AI developers, data scientists, and software engineers who want to build, optimize, and deploy robust RAG systems.

**Prerequisites:** A foundational understanding of Python, Large Language Models (LLMs), and core machine learning concepts is recommended. Familiarity with frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex is beneficial but not required.
